This is the README for the Cortex-M3 (CM3) firmware for power management
on Texas Instruments' AM33XX series of SoCs.

AM33XX integrates a Cortex-M3 core to manage the entry/exit of various
standy-by and deep-sleep mode. More info on this is present in the
AM335X Techinal Reference Manual (TRM) available @ www.ti.com

DOCUMENTATION:

 - The CM3 firmware design document can be found under the
   Documentation/ folder. SA_PM_Firmware.pdf is the best place to start.

 - Most of the diagrams used in the pdf were created using
   Dia, a GTK+ based digram creation program. The original
   *.dia files are also available under Documentation/

 - For more technical detailis refer to the TRM on the TI website.

COMPILING the firmare:

 - Right now a simple shell script is used for compiling the firmware.
   So, a GNU/Linux build environment with the Arago toolchain is a must.
   If these prerequisites are met, invoke the script 'build.sh' present
   under src/. This will generate the binary and elf version of the firmware.

 - Pre-compiled versions of these are available under bin/.

 - Note: A Makefile based build system is under development and most
   likely will be available in the next major update.
